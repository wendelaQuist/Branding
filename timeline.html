    <h1>Red Bull</h1>
    <h2>gives you wings</h2>
    <p>The marketing of Red Bull can be described as unvincible. Their marketing strategies are taken to the extreme, but the effort puts their spectators first. Selling their products comes second.
      Red Bull uses plenty of tactics and mediums to reach their target group, even if they don't care about energy drinks.</p>

      <h1>The story behind Red Bull</h1>
      <h2>1987</h2>
      <p>Dietrich Mateschitz became inspired by functional drinks from the far East. He was working on the concept since 1984 and after 3 years the recipe, brand position, packaging, and marketing concept became reality. Red Bull was launched in Austria
        where the new product category was invented: energy drinks.
